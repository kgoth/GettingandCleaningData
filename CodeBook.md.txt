##Code book to describe the variables, data, and steps used to manipulate the data

#The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 
#A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: 
#These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
#'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

#The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values.
iqr(): Interquartile range
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.
Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

#Transformations performed
#The R script performs the following tasks:

Loads data.table package
Loads the general text files provided about features and activity labels
Add column names to the features and activity labels
Loads training and test datasets along with their respective subject and activity label text files
Subject and activity labels are respectively merged with the training and test data sets
The training and test sets are then merged
A smaller dataset is extracted which only contains mean and standard deviation values
Column names are made meaningful. mean() is replaced with mean, while std() is replaced by stddeviation
Calculations for mean are performed for each subject and activity and stored in a new data table using the data.table tools
Activity names are added to the final data
Finally the data table is written into a text file in the working directory
